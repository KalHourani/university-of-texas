\section*{\underline{Plot Summary}} Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart, two vaudevillains accused of murder in 1920s prohibition-era Chicago, each hire Billy Flynn, a big shot smooth-talking lawyer who has never lost a case, to their legal defense. However, Velma and Roxie find themselves competing for the public's favor as their cases come closer to trial. With a little help from Mama Morton, the prison warden whose motto is ``when you're good to Mama, Mama's good to you,'' some sympathy from the media, an alleged pregnancy, and Flynn's ability to make a show out of a trial, Hart and Kelly are both acquitted and begin a successful career performing a double act.\section*{\underline{Libretto Information}}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Written by Bob Fosse (who also directed and choreographed) and Fred Ebb.
 \item Music by John Kander.
 \item Based on a 1926 play of the same name written by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\underline{Production History}}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Premiered in 1975.
 \item Not received very well, possibly as a result of the high crime rates of the '70s. Critics called the musical cynical. 
 \item Negative reception most likely a result of people not believing that, by having media coverage, someone can be acquitted of murder.
 \item This is evidenced by the positive reception of the 1996 revival, occuring two years after the infamous O.J. Simpson murder trial.
 \item Viewers were also made uncomfortable by the Brechtian style of the musical, in which the fourth wall was frequently dropped.
\end{itemize}
