\section*{\underline{Plot Summary}} Chicago, based on a 1926 play of the same name written by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins, is a musical in which Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart, two vaudevillains accused of murder in 1920s prohibition-era Chicago, each hire Billy Flynn, a big shot smooth-talking lawyer who has never lost a case, to their legal defense. However, Velma and Roxie find themselves competing for the public's favor as their cases come closer to trial. With a little help from Mama Morton, the prison warden whose motto is ``when you're good to Mama, Mama's good to you,'' some sympathy from the media, an alleged pregnancy, and Flynn's ability to make a show out of a trial, Hart and Kelly are both acquitted and begin a successful career performing a double act.

, written by Bob Fosse (who also directed and choreographed) and Fred Ebb, with music by John Kander, \textit{Chicago} received mixed reviews from critics, as many critics felt that the musical was cynical. This may be in part due to the rise in crime during the 1970s, but is most likely a result of people not believing that, by having media coverage, someone can be acquitted of murder. This is further evidenced by the positive reception of the 1996 revival of \textit{Chicago}, occuring two years after the infamous O.J. Simpson murder trial. Viewers were also made uncomfortable by the Brechtian style of the musical, in which the fourth wall was frequently dropped. 

Chicago portrays America's judicial system in a very negative light. By having Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly both acquitted, it suggests that the american judicial system, rather than being a fair assessment of guilt, is instead a show in which the verdict is determined by popular perception of the defendent. As Billy Flynn puts it, ``it's all a circus, Kid. A three ring circus. These trials---the whole world---all show business. But kid, you're working with a star, the biggest!''
